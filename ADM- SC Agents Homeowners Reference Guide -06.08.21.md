**PREMIUM DETERMINATION**

**1. PREMIUM CALCULATION**

Premiums are developed from statewide premium for certain, individual perils. Each base premium is
then multiplied by factors, resulting in a premium for that peril that reflects the characteristics of the
specific exposure. After all factors have been applied, all peril premiums are added together to produce
the Combined Peril Premium. The Total Policy Premium is determined by adding any premiums for
additional coverages and endorsements that are not rated in the peril premiums to the Combined Peril
Premium.

**2. ROUNDING**


A. Premium calculations are to be rounded to the nearest whole dollar following the application of

each rating factor. Amounts of $0.50 or more will be increased.


B. This procedure shall also apply to all interim premium adjustments, including endorsements or

cancellations.

**3. MINIMUM PREMIUM**

A minimum $200 annual written premium is charged for each policy. This will include all chargeable
endorsements or coverages.

**4. WHOLE DOLLAR PREMIUM**

All premiums shown on the policy and endorsements will be rounded to the nearest whole dollar. A
premium of fifty cents ($0.50) or more will be rounded to the next higher whole dollar.

**RATING RULES**

**1. BASE RATE**

This is the starting point for the rating, which is determined by form and by peril.

**2. TERRITORY FACTOR**

The Territory Pages contain the definition and code for each territory.


A. Policies are rated based on the territory for the insured location. For Hurricane peril, the construction

type is also considered.


B. Territories are defined based on zip code and census block. Zip code boundaries are occasionally

changed. For example, a new zip code may be created. If the zip code for an address has changed
since the zip code boundary definitions, the territory will be determined based on the boundary
previously defined for the address using the zip code. For an existing policy whose zip code is
redefined, the territory assigned will not change, unless the Territory Pages have been revised.


C. ZIP codes defined by the USPS as postal boxes will be classified as territory code “default” (0000) or

ZIP codes that cannot be identified will be classified using closest neighboring zip code.

**3. TIER FACTOR**

The Tier Score is determined as multiplication of factors by peril from the following tables:


Insurance Score Band Factor


Presence of Mortgage


Policy Payment History


Pay-On-Time Factor


Insurance Score Band and Age of Insured


Insurance Score Band and Policy Payment History


Insurance Score Band and Loss Free in Three Years


Insurance Score Band and Pay-On-Time Factor


Insurance Score Band and Presence of Mortgage


Coverage A Limit and Presence of Mortgage


Coverage A Limit and Age of Insured


Loss Free in 3 Years and Loss History


Loss History (Catastrophe)


The Tier Score is then used to look up the Tier. The Tier is used to look up a factor on the Tier Factor
table to be used in the rating algorithm.

**4. PROTECTION CLASSIFICATION**

The Protection Classification listings in the ISO Public Protection Classification Location database apply
to risks insured under homeowners program policies.


A. The Protection Classification indicated applies in a municipality or classified area where a single

classification of fire protection is available (8, 7, 6, etc.).


B. In a classification area where two or more classifications are shown (for example, 6/6X), the

classification is determined as follows:
