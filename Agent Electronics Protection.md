Expect **MORE.**

**DID YOU KNOW** **that the average home contains at least 11**
**connected electronic devices? A malfunction of just one of**
**them can be quite inconvenient and costly.**

The more dependent our homes become on technology, the more there is to maintain when that technology breaks down.

Homeowner’s policies cover home systems and electronics in the event of a catastrophic storm, or theft. Fixing home electronics

can be costly, and cause disruption to daily life. To provide added peace of mind to your insureds, recommend an **Orion180**

**Home Electronics Protection Plan** .*

For as little as $17.50/mo homeowners can protect items such as monitors, audio/video streaming devices. Or, for just $31/mo,

they can enjoy Total Electronics Coverage which includes all components from Home Electronics, plus all components from

Smart Home protection plans.
